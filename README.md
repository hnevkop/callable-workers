# Callable Workers Application

Callable workers application is a demo of using Java Future and Callbacks to scale some work across multiple threads. 
e.g. to call an external services and get the response.

## Requirements
java 11
gradle 7.2

## Description of the compoments:
- Worker - A worker is a class that implements Callable interface. It is responsible for doing some work and returning a result. For demo purposes set the sleep time to 500ms to simulate the work.
- WorkersExecutor - A class that is responsible for executing the workers. It takes a list of workers and executes them in parallel, collects the results. 
- WorkerService - A class that is responsible for calling the workers and getting the results. It uses WorkersExecutor to execute the workers. Demo purposes only. 

## Running the application

To run the application, execute the java class in the root directory of the project:
```shell
CallWorkersApplication.java
```

## Scaling the application
See Workers Executor class for the number of threads to be used in the application
, as well as the number of workers to be used. By default it is set to 10 workers and 5 threads. 
Execution results is then: 1000 req/sec with 10 workers and 5 threads.




## Building the application
use gradle to build the application:
```shell
gradle build
```
